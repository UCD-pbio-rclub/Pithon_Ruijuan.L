1. Copy or write the hangman game and then fix the problems in the game which are listed on pg. 55

2. Write a function which takes a sentence as input and returns the reverse order of the words.
ie "these are words" --> "words are these". Bonus: Capitalize the the first letter of the first word and end the returned string with the same punctuation as the input string. ie "these are words!" --> "Words are these!"

3. Write a function which asks the user for a string and prints out whether the string is a palindrome or not

4. Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:

>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
Albert Einstein
Benjamin Franklin
Ada Lovelace
>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
Benjamin Franklin
>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
